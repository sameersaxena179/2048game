Welcome to the repository of my 2048 game:-
a single-player sliding block puzzle game. the game 2048 is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing a smooth and responsive user experience. 
The game's objective is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them and create a tile with the number 2048.. However, you're free to push your score beyond that!
